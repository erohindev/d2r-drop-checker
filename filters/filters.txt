# filter whitelist logic:
# [x][y] - item with x OR y-rarity. Possible values [N]-Normal [M]-magic, [R]-rare, [S]-set, [U]-unique, [HQ]-superior, [LQ]-low quality
# [ETH] - check if item is etheral. [ETH][R] - Etheral AND Rare
# {2} - any item with 2 sockets
# {0} - any item without sockets (use with caution)
# {4-6} - any item with 4, 5 or 6 sockets
# [ETH]{4-6} - any etheral item with 4, 5 or 6 sockets
# [M]{4} - magic item with 4 sockets
# [x] Name - item with x-rarity AND if item name contains 'Name' text (case-sensetive)
# {3} Name - item with 3 sockets AND if item name contains 'Name' text
# Name - check only if item name contains 'Name' text, any number of sockets, any rarity. Filter 'Rune' will display all runes, Rune Swords, Rune Bows...

# Shorter rules have higher priority. If you set "[U]" filter you don't need to set "[U] Shako" filter to see Shako, it will be displayed anyway
# "!-filters" are highest priority filters. "![U]" filter will hide all uniques even if config have "[U]" filter

# {0-6}
# !{1-5} - display any items with 0 or 6 sockets only

# possible item names list: check ID_NAME.txt file
